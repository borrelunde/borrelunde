### Hey, you! I am BÃ¸rre,

Among many things, I like history, chess and mountains.

In the world of programming, I work with embedded C and C++. Other than that I do Java, with Python on the side. With some experience in PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL.

Combined with embedded programming, I work in direct involvement with electronics.
